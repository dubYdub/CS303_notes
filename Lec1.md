*The core of AI is digitalize the real world*

### 1.Basic concepts

#### 1.1 The circle

Sensors -> (Function + Program) -> Actuator -> Actions -> Sensors

#### 1.2 Humanly and rationally

| thinking humanly          | acting humanly | thinking rationally        | acting rationally        |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Needs to understand minds | Turing tests   | needs to define rationally | same as the previous one |
> Rationality means maximize the excepted performance (because of uncertainty)
>
> knowledge base -> help to make decisions -> from known to unknown
>
> agent should gather information and learn from them, in order to be autonomous 



##### Acting humanly :

In order to pass the total Turing test (people can't tell the difference from 		people and AI even in perceptual level), the AI must have 6 disciplines:



- **natural language processing**: to enable it to communicate successfully in English
- **knowledge representation**: to store what it knows or hears
- **automated reasoning**: to use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions
- **machine learning** : to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns
- **computer vision** : to perceive objects
- **robotics** : to manipulate objects and move about



##### Thinking humanly :

We get three ways to determine how humans think



- **introspection**: by thinking deeply about your own feelings and thoughts
- **psychological experiments**: by observing the action and behavior of human 
- **brain image**: by observing the action of human's brain

If program's input-output behavior can match corresponding  the human's behavior, it can be proved that the AI can think humanly



##### Thinking rationally :

- **syllogisms** : 三段论
	 **two main obstacles** ：1. informal condition  2. difference between solving a problem “in principle” and solving it in practice					



**Acting rationally:**

-  **rational agent** : A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome





#### 1.3 three levels of human brains' function

- **decision making** -------- search （in limited choices）

- **inference** ------- Logic reasoning

- **learning** ------- machine learning
